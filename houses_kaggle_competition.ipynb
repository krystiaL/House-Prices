These would be our most important features, which we don't want to remove.\n",

    "The best thing is that `scikit-learn` allows you to integrate this methodology directly into your `preproc` pipeline thanks to the [`SequentialFeatureSelector`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector.html) transformer; this will recursively remove the least important features according to the `cross_val_score`.\n",

For instance, trees with a Gini-based `feature_importance_`, or Lasso regressions with an L1 `coef_`. `scikit-learn` already has the [`SelectFromModel`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel.html) transformer to do just that."
